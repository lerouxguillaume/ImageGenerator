# Architecture Summary

Image generator is structured around a strict separation of:

- UI layer (SFML)
- Control layer (controllers)
- Asset layer (artifact paths, post-processing, scoring)
- Prompt DSL layer (parse / compile / merge)
- Inference layer (ONNX runtime pipeline)
- Preset layer (file-backed configuration persistence)

# Component structure

Views:
- `MenuView` — top-level launcher with `Projects`, `Generate Images`, `Edit Image`, and `Import Model`
- `ProjectView` — themed asset-pack workspace with embedded generation/results
- `ImageGeneratorView(Generate)` — prompt-first txt2img composition root
- `ImageGeneratorView(Edit)` — image-first img2img composition root
- Each `ImageGeneratorView` remains thin and delegates `render()` to shared panels

Panels (own state + rendering + event handling):
- `MenuBar` — top bar: Back, title, optional Presets dropdown, Settings
- `SettingsPanel` — left panel; generate mode shows prompts/preview, edit mode shows source/edit controls
- `ResultPanel` — right panel: image display, Generate/Cancel, progress, gallery actions
- `LlmBar` — bottom bar: LLM toggle, instruction, Enhance (generate screen only)
- `SettingsModal` — settings overlay modal

Controller (`ImageGeneratorController`):
- One instance per workflow mode (`Generate`, `Edit`)
- Thin coordinator: routes events to panels, acts on their action flags
- Owns async operations: model/LoRA scan, LLM load, folder browse, generation thread
- Updates DSL display state (token chips, compiled preview) every frame in generate mode
- Accesses panels directly via `view.panelName.*`

Project workflow:
- `ProjectController` owns project CRUD, theme/asset authoring, and the embedded project workspace layout
- `ProjectController` embeds and reuses `ImageGeneratorController` for generation orchestration, settings modal handling, and gallery behavior
- `ResolvedProjectContext` remains the carrier between project-authored data and generation execution

Asset workflow:
- `AssetArtifactStore` owns generated asset path conventions, candidate-run layouts, metadata sidecar paths, transparent derivative paths, and gallery discovery
- `GeneratedAssetProcessor` owns shared raw-output normalization: alpha cutout, standalone transparent derivatives when applicable, post-processing, processed PNG output, and metadata sidecars
- `CandidateScorer` owns deterministic geometric scoring for candidate-run proposals and gallery ranking
- `PatronGenerator` creates orientation-specific shape references for candidate-run exploration

Import system:
- `MenuController` owns `ModelImporter`, `ImportedModelRegistry`, and `ImportModelModal`
- `ModelImporter` runs the full import flow on a background thread (inspect → venv setup → subprocess → validate → register)
- `ImportModelModal` is an overlay modal; controller calls `renderOverlay()` each frame after `menuScreen.render()`
- Venv is placed in `localDataDir()` (platform-appropriate local path) to avoid shared-drive limitations

UI theme system:
- `Theme` centralizes `UiColors`, `UiMetrics`, and `UiTypography`
- shared rendering helpers and newer views consume theme tokens directly
- `src/enum/constants.hpp` remains as compatibility glue while older code paths migrate

# Prompt DSL architecture

```
raw text (UI)
    ↓ PromptParser::parse()
Prompt DSL { subject, styles, positive[], negative[] }
    ↓ PromptMerge::merge()  ← optional LLM patch
merged Prompt DSL
    ↓ PromptCompiler::compile(dsl, ModelType)
prompt string → inference pipeline
```

The DSL is re-parsed from text areas on every relevant operation (generation, preset save,
LLM enhancement, per-frame display update). It is not stored as persistent UI state.

---

# SD pipeline architecture

The pipeline is a linear graph:

CLIP → UNet (CFG loop) → Scheduler → VAE → Image

Each component is:
- stateless per call
- driven by GenerationContext
- cached via ModelManager

---

# Model system architecture

Two-layer model system:

1. SdLoader
  - Resolves model.json
  - Builds ModelInstance

2. ModelManager
  - Caches ModelInstances by ModelCacheKey
  - Prevents redundant session creation

---

# LoRA architecture

LoRA injection occurs at model load time:

- ONNX external initializer patching
- weight merging via safetensors
- suffix-based tensor matching

No runtime graph mutation occurs.

---

# Execution isolation model

Each generation run:
- clones session options
- resets run_opts
- isolates cancellation state

---

# Key design decisions

The system prioritizes:
- determinism over flexibility
- caching over recomputation
- static graphs over dynamic graph editing
- DSL as source of truth for prompts, not raw strings
